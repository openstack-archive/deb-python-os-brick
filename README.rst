OpenStack Cinder brick library for managing local volume attaches


Features
--------

* Discovery of volumes being attached to a host for many transport protocols.
* Removal of volumes from a host.

Hacking
-------

Hacking on brick requires python-gdbm (for Debian derived distributions),
Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. A recent tox is required, as is a recent virtualenv
(13.1.0 or newer).

If "tox -e py34" fails with the error "db type could not be determined", remove
the .testrepository/ directory and then run "tox -e py34".
